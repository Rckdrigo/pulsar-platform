# Memory Bank - Luna (Frontend)

This memory bank provides unified context for both Cline and Claude Code when working with the Luna frontend application.

## Single Source of Truth

This consolidated memory bank maintains project-specific context for the Luna frontend while referencing the main Pulsar Interactive memory bank for shared context.

## Files Overview

- `project-context.md` - Luna-specific project overview, architecture, and development guidelines
- `current-state.md` - Active development status, recent changes, and next steps
- `technical-patterns.md` - Frontend-specific patterns, conventions, and implementation details

## Usage

Both Cline and Claude Code should reference these files alongside the main project memory bank to maintain consistent context about:
- Luna-specific project structure and components
- Frontend development commands and workflows
- Current progress and priorities specific to Luna
- Technical decisions and patterns for React/Vite development

This memory bank is kept lean and focused on actionable information specific to the Luna frontend application.
