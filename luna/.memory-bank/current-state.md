# Current State - Luna (Frontend)

## Project Status

**Current Phase**: Setup and Initial Development
**Last Updated**: September 15, 2024

## Recent Activity

### Infrastructure Setup
- Project structure established with React 18 + Vite
- Chakra UI integration configured
- Development tooling (ESLint, Prettier) configured
- Memory bank documentation system implemented

## Active Development Areas

### Priority 1: Core Infrastructure
- [ ] Socket.IO client integration with Pulsar backend
- [ ] Configuration management system implementation
- [ ] Basic component library establishment
- [ ] Routing and navigation setup

### Priority 2: Feature Development
- [ ] Configuration interface components
- [ ] Real-time update mechanisms
- [ ] User interface for Pulsar API consumption
- [ ] Responsive design implementation

### Priority 3: Integration
- [ ] End-to-end testing with Pulsar backend
- [ ] Production build optimization
- [ ] Deployment configuration
- [ ] Documentation completion

## Technical Decisions Made

### Architecture Choices
- **React 18**: Latest React features with concurrent rendering
- **Vite**: Fast development server and optimized builds
- **Chakra UI**: Comprehensive design system for consistent UI
- **Functional Components**: Hook-based architecture throughout

### Development Workflow
- ESLint + Prettier for code quality
- Git integration with main Pulsar Interactive repository
- Memory bank system for context preservation

## Known Issues

### Current Blockers
- None identified at this time

### Technical Debt
- Initial setup still in progress
- Test coverage needs establishment
- Production deployment pipeline not yet configured

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next Session)
1. Complete Socket.IO client integration
2. Implement basic configuration display components
3. Establish connection with Pulsar backend API
4. Set up basic routing structure

### Short Term (Next Few Sessions)
1. Build out core component library
2. Implement real-time configuration updates
3. Add comprehensive error handling
4. Establish testing framework

### Medium Term (Next Sprint)
1. Complete feature parity with requirements
2. Optimize for production deployment
3. Integrate with Planet project management features
4. Comprehensive documentation

## Development Environment

### Dependencies Status
- All core dependencies installed and configured
- Development server operational
- Build process functional
- Linting and formatting working

### Integration Status
- Pulsar backend: Ready for integration
- Planet services: Coordination needed
- Memory bank: Fully implemented and operational

## Notes for Next Session

### Context to Remember
- Luna serves as the primary frontend for Pulsar Interactive
- Real-time integration with Pulsar backend is critical
- Chakra UI design system should be used consistently
- Memory bank system is established and should be maintained

### Files to Reference
- Main project memory bank in root directory
